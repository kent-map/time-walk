# About the Project

Let’s Do The Time Walk Again! Exploring the East Kent Coast Through Digital Heritage is a National Lottery Heritage funded project. Canterbury Christ Church University has been awarded £67,397.00 by the National Lottery Heritage Fund to work with four coastal museums in East Kent to help preserve their archives, upskill volunteers in key digital practices and tell the story of these towns beyond their traditional seaside heritage. Through a series of training workshops volunteers will learn to record at-risk archives and develop their digital story-telling skills, creating web content that will explore different aspects of 19th and 20th century life in Broadstairs, Ramsgate, Deal and Sandwich.


# About the National Lottery
{: .wrap}

The National Lottery Heritage Fund is the largest funder for the UK’s heritage. Using money raised by National Lottery players we support projects that connect people and communities to heritage. Our vision is for heritage to be valued, cared for and sustained for everyone, now and in the future. From historic buildings, our industrial legacy and the natural environment, to collections, traditions, stories and more. Heritage can be anything from the past that people value and want to pass on to future generations. We believe in the power of heritage to ignite the imagination, offer joy and inspiration, and to build pride in place and connection to the past.

## The Clock House Museum Ramsgate

![](The_Clock_House_Museum_Ramsgate.jpg)

The Ramsgate Clock House Museum contains documents relating to the history of the harbour including the letter conveying King George IV’s “Gracious Pleasure that this port be called “The Royal Harbour of Ramsgate” and ‘Harbour Minutes Register’ 1909-1915 covering the early years of WW1. 

Roman artefacts with contemporary graffiti, recovered from the Richborough fort, as well as WW1 graffiti and important documents to tell the harbour’s story, linking to Dunkirk small boats. The harbour, like the town, was subject to enemy attack and related problems and dangers associated with wartime activity. Image credit: Penny Mayes, The Clockhouse, Royal Harbour, Ramsgate.

## Deal Museum

![](Deal_Museum.jpg)

Deal Museum holds large collections of postcards, prints, photographs, records and newspapers that show the history of the town through the ages: naval town; smuggling town; base for the Royal Marines; mining town and seaside resort. 

The thread running through it is the beach - for example the by-elections in 1880 saw the beach as a site of electioneering, corruption and rioting, with canvassers jockeying to influence residents with ‘a pint or a purse’, resulting in the effective disenfranchisement of the constituency.

## The Dickens Museum, Broadstairs

![](The_Dickens_Museum_Broadstairs.jpg)

Collections at the Dickens Museum, Broadstairs include Dickensiana and related items documenting the importance of Dickens’s legacy to the town. They include rare editions, 20th century Dickens Festival slides and programmes; photographs of author and festival organiser, Gladys Waterer. 

Other unique items relating to Thanet include the rate book for Broadstairs and St Peter’s 1838-39 and rate book for St Peter’s 1843 including lodgings occupied by Marian Evans (George Eliot). Image Credit: Tony Hisgett from Birmingham, UK, CC BY 2.0, via Wikimedia Commons

## The Guildhall Museum, Sandwich

![](The_Guildhall_Museum_Sandwich.jpg)

Sandwich Guildhall Museum holds early 20th century postcards and cartes de visite. These collections show the vibrant life of the Cinque Port town, which has close links with neighbouring Deal, including correspondence addresses of early visitors to Sandwich that will stimulate research into visitor demographics from the start of the last century. This history has been eclipsed due to the greater accessibility of records relating to Thanet resorts.
