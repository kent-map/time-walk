# Adding a new post

1. Select and copy the post template text from [_admin/template/index.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juncture-digital/template/main/_admin/template/index.md)

2. In the root folder of the collection for the post (for example, the [_articles](_articles) folder), select `Add file` > `+ Create new file` from the menu located in the top right section of the page.

  - Name a name for the new post using the input area with `Name your file...` placeholder.  The file name should be a short name for the post (using lowercase text, numbers and hyphens) followed by `/index.md`.  For example, `monument-valley/index.md`
  - Paste the post template text into the input area with `Enter file contents here` placeholder.  The pasted text contains the front matter for the post.  The post front matter is used for indexing and display.
  - Update the front matter fields:
    - **title**: 
    - **description**: 
    - **author**: 
    - **date**: Publish date in the form of `YYYY-MM-DD`
    - **tags**: Optional tags for categorizing the post.  Multiple tags are space separated.  Refer to the [Adding a new tag](add-tag) page for information on how new tags are added. 
    - **thumbnail**: 
    - **permalink**: 
    - **published**: This is set to `false` initially.  When the value is false the post will not appear in the post index.
    - **featured**: This is set to `false` initially.  Set this to `true` if the post should appear in the Featured section of the collection index page.
