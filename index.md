## Exploring the East Kent Coast
{: .hero-overlay}

Stories of 19th and 20th century seaside life in Broadstairs, Ramsgate, Deal, and Sandwich.

##

Exploring the East Kent Coast Through Digital Heritage is a National Lottery Heritage funded project. Canterbury Christ Church University has been awarded Â£67,397.00 by the National Lottery Heritage Fund to work with four coastal museums in East Kent to help preserve their archives, upskill volunteers in key digital practices and tell the story of these towns beyond their traditional seaside heritage. Through a series of training workshops volunteers will learn to record at-risk archives and develop their digital story-telling skills, creating web content that will explore different aspects of 19th and 20th century life in Broadstairs, Ramsgate, Deal and Sandwich.
