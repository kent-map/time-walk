‘Royal Ramsgate’, so-called because Princess Victoria had spent holidays there in 1835 and 1836, largely succeeded in distancing itself from its more louche counterpart Margate in the popular imagination, for most of the 19th century. Jane Austen was a visitor and Dickens’s ‘The Tuggses at Ramsgate’ sends a newly monied Tuggs family to Ramsgate as a genteel holiday destination where – by implication – they will be safe from meeting any of their old friends. Wilkie Collins contrived to spend holidays here with both Caroline Graves and Martha Rudd (lodging at separate but nearby addresses) in the 1870s. Nonetheless The fictional cockney tourist Mrs Brown complains in 1874 that ‘parties is a deal too genteel there for me’1, and as late as 1897 John Strange Winter (Henrietta Stannard) dissects the Thanet seaside resorts in A Seaside Flirt as ‘quiet little Westgate, dull Birchington , vulgar Margate’ and ‘detestable stuck-up Ramsgate’ respectively.2

The Granville Hotel opened in 1869, catered to a wealthy clientele - guests included Florence Nightingale - and features in the Zig Zag Guide by Punch editor and Ramsgate resident F. C. Burnand in the 1890s.
